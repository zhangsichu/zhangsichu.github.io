### For Existing Posts

Posts that need category updates based on the standardized list:

#### Posts to be recategorized:

1. **AI-related posts** (2025 posts about coding assistants) → `Generative AI`
2. **Software engineering posts** (security, architecture) → `软件工程`
3. **Development efficiency posts** → `研发效能`
4. **Community and speaking posts** → `社区/演讲`

### Category Decision Tree

1. **Is it about AI/ML technologies?** → `Generative AI`
2. **Is it about web technologies?** → `Web开发`
3. **Is it about .NET or Java?** → `.Net/Java`
4. **Is it about C++ or C?** → `C++/C`
