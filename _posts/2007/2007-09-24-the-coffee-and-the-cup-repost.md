A group of alumni, highly established in their careers, got together to visit their old university professor.  

Conversation soon turned into complaints about stress in work and life. Offering his guests coffee, the professor went to the kithchen and returned with a large pot of coffee and an assortment of cups, porcelain, plastic, glass, crystal, some plain looking, some expensive, some exquisite- telling them to help themselves to hot coffee.  

When all the students had a cup of coffee in hand, the professor said:"If you noticed, all the nice looking expensive cups were taken up, leaving behind the plain and cheap ones. What all of you really wanted was a cup of coffee, not the cup, but you consiously went for the best cups and were eyeing each others cups.  

Now if life is coffee, then the jobs, money and position in society are the cups. They are just tools to hold and contain Life, but the quality of Life doesnt change. Some times, by concentrating only on the cup, we fail to enjoy the coffee in it.  

Dont let the cups drive you... Enjoy the coffee instead.
