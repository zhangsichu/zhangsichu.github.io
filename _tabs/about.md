# **Sichu Zhang**
Technical Principal, Thoughtworks

---

I’m a seasoned software architect and engineering leader with over two decades of experience shaping large-scale digital platforms.

As a Technical Principal at Thoughtworks’ China Offshore Delivery Center, I focus on cloud-native microservices, modern .NET/Java, JavaScript, and Python ecosystems, and driving impact through DevOps, DevSecOps automation, and engineering effectiveness.

Over the years, I’ve led the delivery of complex financial platforms, championed the adoption of AI-powered development tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Haiven, and designed metrics frameworks that help teams deliver faster and better. What excites me most is guiding teams to unlock their potential—whether through architecture leadership, AI-enablement strategies, or mentoring future tech leaders.

Beyond delivery, I contribute to the wider community as the author of thought leadership that’s been recognized across the industry.
